# Cyber Security Internship – Task 7  
## Web Application Vulnerability Testing

### Objective
The objective of this task is to identify common web application vulnerabilities by performing security testing based on the OWASP Top 10 framework.

### Tools Used
- Burp Suite Community Edition  
- OWASP Juice Shop (Vulnerable Web Application)  
- Web Browser

### Task Description
In this task, a vulnerable web application was tested to identify security flaws such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). HTTP requests were intercepted and analyzed using Burp Suite.

### Vulnerabilities Identified
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Outcome
This task helped in understanding how web applications can be exploited due to improper input validation and insecure coding practices.

### Files Included
- Report.pdf – Detailed vulnerability assessment report
- Screenshots – Evidence of testing (if applicable)

### Conclusion
Web application security testing is crucial to identify and fix vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.
