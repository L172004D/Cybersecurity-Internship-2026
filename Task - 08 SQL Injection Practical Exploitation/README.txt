# Cyber Security Internship – Task 8  
## SQL Injection Practical Exploitation

### Objective
The objective of this task is to identify and exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities to understand their impact on database security.

### Tools Used
- SQLMap  
- Linux Terminal  

### Task Description
A deliberately vulnerable web application was tested using SQLMap. Injectable parameters were identified and databases, tables, and user data were extracted for educational purposes.

### Key Activities
- Detection of SQL Injection vulnerability
- Database enumeration
- Table and data extraction
- Impact analysis

### Outcome
This task provided hands-on experience in understanding how attackers exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities and why secure coding is critical.

### Files Included
- Report.pdf – Detailed SQL Injection exploitation report
- Screenshots – SQLMap execution results (if applicable)

### Conclusion
SQL Injection is a high-risk vulnerability that can lead to complete database compromise if not properly mitigated.
