# Cyber Security Internship – Task 9  
## Network Vulnerability Scanning

### Objective
The objective of this task is to perform network reconnaissance to identify open ports, running services, and potential security risks.

### Tools Used
- Nmap  
- Linux Operating System  

### Task Description
A local network was scanned using Nmap to discover live hosts, open ports, services, and operating system details. The scan results were analyzed to identify potential vulnerabilities.

### Scan Activities
- Port scanning
- Service detection
- OS fingerprinting
- Risk analysis

### Outcome
This task improved understanding of how exposed services increase the attack surface of a network.

### Files Included
- Report.pdf – Network scan analysis report
- Screenshots – Nmap scan results (if applicable)

### Conclusion
Regular network vulnerability scanning is essential to maintain a secure network environment.
